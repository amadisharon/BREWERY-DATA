## üß† Key Insights

### üåç Top Performing Market
- **Senegal** consistently outperformed the other four countries across all KPIs ‚Äî Profit, Revenue, and ROI.

### üìÖ Best Fiscal Year
- **2018** stood out as the strongest year based on:
  - Highest **Revenue Growth Rate (RGR)** at **2.98%**
  - Highest **Sales Growth Rate (SGR)** at **-3.83%**, which despite being negative, was less steep than other years, suggesting relatively stable sales.

### üç∫ Brand Analysis
- **Castle Lite**: Most **profitable brand** overall.
- **Beta Life**: Most **cost-efficient brand**, offering high profitability at lower production costs.
- **Budweiser**: Achieved **100% ROI**, indicating strong pricing, operational, and sales strategy alignment.

### üìà RGR vs SGR Correlation
- There‚Äôs a **strong inverse relationship** between **Revenue Growth Rate** and **Sales Growth Rate** in some months, especially in 2019.
- This suggests that **fewer sales may be generating more revenue**, pointing to:
  - Higher pricing models
  - Premium branding efforts
  - Possibly reduced demand but better margins
- **Implication**: Strategy may be shifting toward **value over volume**.
